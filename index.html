      <h2>UDems June 3 Endorsement Forum Questionaire</h2>
      <h3>Senate District 14</h3>
      <h4>How will you continue Kirk Watson&rsquo;s legacy of protecting Austin and UT specifically?</h4><br>

          <p>Senator Watson was an outstanding leader and someone I enjoyed working closely with for many years. He has &#8203;worked heavily on sexual assault in a recent legislative sessions and passed groundbreaking legislation.&#8203; Continuing his legacy and building on the gains we have made in the legislature is vitally important to me. I have been a strong supporter of local control in previous sessions and would support legislation that protects Austin by ensuring that local government can continue to have the ability to make the best decisions for our community. &#8203;I have also worked on issues related to equity for Latino faculty/staff. I hosted and helped plan a presentation with the &#8203;Texas House&rsquo;s Mexican American Legislative Caucus and eight Hispanic professors to discuss issues of disparity they face at the University and am committed to continuing my work with UT. I deeply believe that all people deserve equal rights and treatment regardless of their race, gender identity, or sexual orientation.</p>

            <p>Senator Watson set the standard for bipartisan leadership and staying at the table to get things done. I will build on the Senator&rsquo;s legacy of accomplishments in government transparency, women&rsquo;s rights, healthcare including mental health, transportation including transit, and quality K-12 and higher education. With regard to UT specifically, I am a proud graduate of the University of Texas. I attended both the LBJ School and the Law School. I have been an adjunct professor at the LBJ School. And, I am currently on the LBJ Dean&rsquo;s Advisory Committee working on ways to virtualize graduate level education here and in Washington DC. I know firsthand how UT plays an integral role in training future leaders in Texas and the US. We need to make sure that the state continues to financially support this (and all) universities so that the burden doesn&rsquo;t continue to shift onto student tuition, thus squeezing out lower income and nontraditional students from accessing the promise and opportunity afforded by a 4-year degree. A person&rsquo;s economic prospects significantly improve with a college degree. This has a multi-generational impact that reaches every aspect of our society.</p>

          <p>Due to the budget deficit we will most likely find ourselves in, I believe there are a number of issues that are critically important to address. However, my top priority will be addressing &#8203;Affordability in Austin and Central Texas.&#8203; &#8203;I plan on working together with the City of Austin to restore its ability to utilize the powerful tools available to it under the Homestead Preservation Act that I passed in 2005 that can be used to help keep people in their homes and grow the available stock of affordable housing. The City of Austin has outgrown the original &ldquo;bracket eligibility language&rdquo; in the Homestead Preservation Act and Governor Abbott vetoed my effort to update the language in 2017, resulting in the dissolution of three of Austin&rsquo;s four Homestead Preservation Districts. I also intend on continuing to fight against the source of income discrimination often faced by individuals and families who rely on federal housing vouchers to pay their rent by refiling a bill that I filed in the 86th Legislative Session (HB 2187).</p>

            <p>Fair access to justice, not just in Travis County but across the state, is urgent. The sword of justice is heavy and sharp and should be used as judiciously as possible. We know that once someone has become involved with the criminal justice system, their access to opportunity is significantly diminished. I will strengthen protections for sexual assault victims, limit incarceration to only individuals who are a danger to the public, and increase access to mental health services.</p>

            <p>I am not a Jonhnie Come Lately to criminal justice reform. In law school, my first clients were children at the Juvenile Public Defender&rsquo;s Office. As an Assistant Travis County Attorney I prosecuted Family Violence Assaults. And as a Commissioner and County Judge I have worked with others to implement a Mental Health Public Defender&rsquo;s Office, expand alternatives to arrest, reduce the jail population to our lowest levels since 2009, blow the whistle on and reform APD&rsquo;s DNA lab, and fund the first Adult Public Defender&rsquo;s Office in Travis County.</p>

          <h4>We are working like hell to gain 9 house seats in November. When we win and legislation is brought to you, how will you navigate a likely Republican majority to push progressive bills through the Senate?</h4><br>

          <p>I have a deep history of being able to work with members from across the aisle while still fighting and standing firm in our progressive values. It is vitally important for the next Senator of SD 14 to have the relationships needed to pass progressive legislation. I have served with many of the Republicans in the Senate and have a proven record of doing this.</p>

            <p>I am solution oriented and open to progressive compromise. Both the Conference of Urban Counties and the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization are predominantly Republican organizations. Both bodies have repeatedly elected me to leadership positions because of my ability to stay at the table and get us to solutions. I will bring fresh eyes and fresh energy to working with my Senate colleagues in areas where we can find common ground. The key to progress is knowing when to compromise and when to stand your ground. As a lawyer and policy maker, I have a demonstrated track record of successfully negotiating progress.</p>

          <h4>Now more than ever we&rsquo;ve seen how difficult it is to keep voters engaged online. Both during the election and throughout your term, how will you keep constituents engaged in the work being done in the State Senate?</h4><br>

          <strong>Eddie Rodriguez</strong> <br>
            <p>As the importance of social media has grown, I have made it a concerted effort to enhance my online presence. Our campaign has hosted virtual town halls, engaged as much as possible with our social media followers, and encouraged supporters to extend our 21st century grassroots organizing to social media. I am committed to keeping constituents engaged online once I am in the Senate.</p>

            <p>I have as a personal and professional philosophy that 1. everyone is welcome and 2. no one is an enemy forever. I will take meetings with anyone. And, I have for 12 years invited anyone to meet me for Coffee Jolts (mornings) and Policy Pints (happy hours) at coffee houses and restaurants throughout the county. Anyone can come, no appointment necessary, to ask questions, share good ideas or to rip me a new one.</p>

            <p>In Covid-19, these events have become virtual. Additionally, I have utilized regular videos to provide community updates on the public health response to the pandemic. And we have all learned the benefits of video conferencing platforms to connect with our community. I plan to carry these virtual tools forward into the State Senate without diminishing the in-person engagements once the threat of Covid-19 has passed.</p>
