          Texas will be the biggest battleground state in the country in 2020, and I believe I am the candidate with the message, resources, and operation needed to reach voters and win this seat. The campaign has started implementing our path to victory by investing heavily in digital, spending almost $600,000 since getting into the race, more than double what Senator Cornyn has spent. The strong foundation the campaign has built will be a key factor in allowing us to easily and efficiently scale up to meet the needs of a general election against Senator Cornyn.<br><br>

    Since entering the race in late April, I have traveled tens of thousands of miles to talk with thousands of Texans in San Antonio, Dallas, Lubbock, Houston, El Paso, McAllen and dozens of other communities about my record of taking on and succeeding in tough fights. From meeting with labor unions in apprentice shops and on the picket line to talking gun violence prevention in the living rooms of passionate activists to hearing from local leaders in our border communities about the challenges they are facing to visiting health care clinics to hear from patients and providers about what needs to be done to make health care more affordable, I am building a coalition across Texas of folks who are ready for change.

          While I fell a little short in my 2018 race in TX-31, I am proud that we were able to help support the campaigns of Rep. Bucy and Rep. Talarico to flip two state house seats. Beyond sharing field offices and resources, both candidates made me a better candidate -- and informed my perspective. I am planning on running a very coordinated state-wide campaign because I believe that the fight for our values happens at every level of government, and no one person can do any of this alone. We need to flip the state House, break the Republican super-majority in the state Senate, and push up 38 electoral votes to the Democratic nominee in November. I am inspired by candidates like Jennifer Skidenenko and Kayla Alix, two down-ballot candidates I've already gotten to join on the campaign trail, and I'm looking forward to a lot more collaboration across the state.

          Beto inspired and built a statewide grassroots volunteer machine that all Texas Democrats are benefiting from today. From the volunteers and organizers that he helped to cultivate or from hope that he inspired in Democrats young and old across the nation, Beto's 2018 campaign set the precedent that Texas can and will be a blue state, if we put in the work. We are building on the work done by Beto's 2018 campaign and Wendy Davis's 2014 gubernatorial race, but we are also adapting to the new challenges of 2020, and running a campaign for this state in this particular political moment.

          I believe climate change and access to quality, affordable health care are the most important issues -- but I don't think we can do anything without getting corruption and dark money out of politics. <br><br>

Whenever someone tells me they don't understand why a bill passed or decision was made in Washington, I always tell them to follow the money. That's because far too many of our elected leaders make decisions about what legislation to support or oppose based on who is writing the biggest campaign checks &mdash; from the gun lobby to private prisons to Big Pharma &mdash; instead of what is best for their constituents. It is time to clean up our broken system and return the power back to people. That's why I am refusing to accept any corporate PAC money and am proud to be endorsed by End Citizens United. Once elected, I will make it a priority to overturn partisan gerrymandering schemes that further polarize our politics, fight the increasingly-common voter suppression tactics designed to keep people from exercising their right to participate in our democracy, and pass comprehensive campaign finance and ethics reforms that ensure Washington is accountable to the voters &mdash; and no one else. <br> <br>

The rising cost of health care is the number one issue I hear about from Texans on the campaign trail. Texas has the highest uninsured rate in the nation, and that's unacceptable. We must create a public option to make Medicare available for all those who want it. The best health care I've ever had was when I was on military-provided Tricare, similar to Medicare, and I believe that kind of high-quality care should be made available to all Americans. Every child should be covered, period. We can and must protect the progress made by the Affordable Care Act while making much-needed improvements. Far too many folks here in Texas struggle to afford their prescriptions. I will advocate for measures to lower the cost of prescription drugs like allowing Medicare to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, I believe we must hold Big Pharma interests accountable for their part in the opioid epidemic that has ravaged so many communities here in Texas and beyond. <br><br>

As the mother of two little boys, climate change is one of the top reasons I decided to run for Senate. Climate change is one of the greatest threats to the health and safety of our communities, the world we are leaving for the next generation, and our national security. We cannot wait any longer to take action. We must set aggressive goals for the expansion of clean, renewable energy, and invest in clean energy manufacturing and sustainable transportation. Texas has the opportunity to be America's leader in wind and solar energy, and we should use our natural, renewable resources to create jobs here in our state. We also must modernize our energy grid so it is equipped to handle increased load during peak usage.

          The most pressing issue the County Attorney will need to address is the racial disparities in our jails. While the data changes daily, as of today, 32% of those in the Travis County Jail are African Americans while they only makeup 8% of our population. There needs to be a comprehensive review of all policies as well as an overhaul and reform of policies like cash bail. We also need to reform the plea process that too often forces those without privilege and wealth to plead guilty to offenses just to get out of jail. Too often failed policies have the greatest consequences on our low income and black and brown community. Convictions on someone's record then cause a domino effect on other aspects of an individuals life - they have a harder time getting a job or housing, then they can't fully support themselves and their families. We can ensure safety in our community without having disparate impacts and life changing negative consequences on our minority communities.

          <strong>We MUST end mass incarceration.</strong> The best way for us to do this is to take steps to end &ldquo;direct file&rdquo; by the police. Under the current poorly designed system of &ldquo;direct file&rdquo; there is no prosecutor between the police and the jail to push back and reject police charges when there is evidence of police bias. Thus, police bias enters the misdemeanor system! This is OUTRAGEOUS and it must stop. If there is evidence of police bias, one of my prosecutors should REJECT the charge, not open a misdemeanor file. <br><br>

Further, middle class and upper class arrestees are able to pay expensive lawyers to clear their records, but if an arrestee can&rsquo;t afford to hire a lawyer, then that person is stuck with a cloud on their record; unable to obtain student loans, housing, or certain jobs and perhaps even deported because of a misdemeanor. This is WRONG and must stop. I will direct arrestees to free expunction and record clearing services regardless of income level. <br><br>

Further, we are criminalizing too many behaviors in school. This is leading to the <strong>SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE.</strong> I will work with school districts to use restorative justice practices, such as mediation, rather than criminalizing every push, graffiti incident or strong word. We MUST get the heavy hand of the law OUT of our schools.

          Generally, I do not believe that we should prosecute sex workers and would RESIST putting taxpayer money into such harassing prosecution. Sex work is work and in my view sex workers need access to health care and rights under labor laws. Some of these benefits are already available to sex workers in the Netherlands.  However, human trafficking is a problem in Austin, which is made worse by large festivals such as F1 and SXSW.  When we suspect that human trafficking is occurring, we need to look at these matters on a case-by-case basis so that law enforcement can protect those who’ve been pulled into the system against their will.  In my view, case-by-case review of suspected human trafficking is in-line with the Coalition Against Sexual Misconduct on Campus, since it too seeks to protect victims of sexual misconduct while balancing the rights of the accused.

           I am most proud of the work I did to change the governance of the City of Austin to a more representative and progressive 10-1 structure. Because of that, I have had the opportunity to lead on several policy reforms like better access to comprehensive healthcare for City of Austin employees, reforming many policies in our municipal court system, and increasing funding for social services, abortion services, and for an immigrant defense fund. None of that would have been possible if I had not gotten elected to the Austin City Council. And that would not have been possible if I had not been part of the grassroots coalition that changed the governance of the City of Austin to the 10-1 system.

          Yes, absolutely. No one should be forced to stay in jail because they are poor.  Travis County has moved away from cash bond and uses personal bond whereby an arrestee is released based upon their word that they will return for a hearing.  Use of personal bond has recently expanded in Travis County and I will fight for further expansion. I find it UNACCEPTABLE that anyone should be held in jail simply because they are poor.

          Shortly after graduating from the University of Texas School of Law, I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to begin working at a non profit domestic violence shelter. I worked at the Support Network for Battered Women as an advocate. During my work there, I was contacted by several South Asian immigrant women - many of whom had immigrated to the United States with their spouses on H1-B visas. The women who contacted me felt comfortable speaking with me about the domestic violence they were experiencing because I am an immigrant and I too had been exposed to family violence as a child. As the number of women who contacted me grew, I decided to create a support group specifically for South Asian women. It was very grassroots and we held it every week in the lobby of the agency after hours. The group grew in size because the participants had a safe space to talk about their experiences. To this day, I am most proud of the support group I created because it changed the narrative of many of the women who were victims of abuse.

          I have dedicated my career to breaking the cycle of incarceration and ensuring my clients, many of whom cannot afford an attorney on their own, receive equal access to justice. Far too often, we see instances in our criminal justice system where people are not given a fair shake in court because they are not able to afford legal services. I understand the impact when I am able to get a case dismissed or obtain an acquittal for a client. I&#39;m committed to be a voice for so many people in order for their faith to be restored in the criminal justice system. For example, one of my cases involved a young African-American male who was just 19 when I represented him. When I met with him he was in custody in the Travis County jail, and this was not his first time. At the young age of 19, his criminal history included juvenile history, misdemeanors, and a couple of felony convictions. When I brought up the possibility of getting him out of jail on personal recognizance bonds, he said not to bother, as he had never been granted a personal recognizance bond before. I was able to get him released on a bond because I discussed his case with the Judge and proposed reasonable conditions that would make the Court comfortable with his release. In addition, his family violence case in County Court at Law #4 was dismissed as he agreed to complete counseling and treatment. Unfortunately, this happens too often. This young man discounted the possibility of getting out of jail or getting a second chance because of his prior experiences. As his advocate, I was grateful for the opportunity to show that change and rehabilitation are possible for him within the criminal justice system.

      <div class="col-6">
        <p>
          <strong>Dimple Malhotra</strong> <br>
          There are two equally pressing issues that should be addressed. The first relates to the fact that County Court at Law 4 handles all of Travis County&rsquo;s misdemeanor domestic violence cases. Because this is a domestic violence court, <strong>it is important that the judge be someone who understands how to protect both the victims and the community as a whole while ensuring that the defendant receives compassionate justice ,</strong> and that takes a judge with experience in this highly specialized field. Domestic violence is a complex issue, and my experience enables me to differentiate between cases where treatment and diversion can help an offender break the cycle of domestic violence and cases with a high risk of lethality where the defendant is a credible threat to the victim and the community.<br><br>

I was appointed to this bench by the Travis County Commissioners over my opponent because of my 20 years of domestic violence experience. I gained 13 years of highly valuable criminal trial experience through my work as Chief of the Family Violence Unit at the D.A.&#39;s Office (where I handled felony family violence cases ranging from strangulations to homicides while supervising and training nine Assistant DA&rsquo;s), as the Chief Prosecutor for County Court 4 at the County Attorney&rsquo;s Office, and as Chief of the Protective Order Division where we secured protective orders for victims of sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, and domestic violence. Prior to that, I spent 7 years at non-profit domestic violence agencies in Austin and the SF Bay Area working as both a legal advocate and a staff attorney. I assisted survivors of domestic violence in obtaining protective orders, custody orders, and child support. My experience also helps me understand how domestic violence can impact people beyond just the victim and the defendant. A few years ago, a defendant in a family violence case threatened not only the victim with harm but threatened to murder both me and two other prosecutors. The defendant listed each of us by name and claimed to already have our home addresses. We were especially concerned because the defendant was both highly educated and former military. As an officer of the court, I was fortunate to have police protection until the defendant was captured by the FBI, but that is obviously not the case for others in the community that may find themselves caught in the fray of a domestic violence situation.<br><br>

<strong>The second issue relates to the backlog of cases I inherited when I was appointed in October 2019 .</strong> In my short time on the bench, we have already reduced the backlog by over 20%. I am also working with the County Attorney&rsquo;s Office to create a backlog task force to move cases along and further reduce the backlog. Once the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders are lifted and we resume a normal court schedule, I will continue working hard to bring further reductions to the backlog.

          This court has the largest backlog of cases of any misdemeanor court, preventing justice from being served. Lack of a speedy trial impacts employment, housing, and safety. We need a more productive pre-trial process and to uphold current law around timelines for each side to be ready for trial. I will also work to systematically transfer all non-intimate cases to the other courts and advocate for making treatment and counseling more financially accessible.&#160; <br><br>
As a criminal defense attorney, I understand the systemic challenges we are facing in the criminal justice system. To address these challenges, we must protect a defendant&rsquo;s rights and freedoms, prevent individuals from being jailed for excessive time periods, and consider firearm forfeiture when a firearm is involved, as well as balance the need to preserve the community&rsquo;s and victims&rsquo; safety.<br><br>
Currently, if a defendant has an assault family violence case and another case (for example, a DWI or a shoplifting case), those cases are transferred away from County Court at Law #4 and into other misdemeanor courts. It is time for assault family violence cases to be heard by misdemeanor court judges who are experienced to hear these cases.<br><br>
It is critical the next Judge of County Court at Law #4 be a qualified and compassionate attorney who will correct the ongoing, systemic issues with this court. I have extensive experience practicing in Court #4 and am the only candidate who has served as a staff attorney defending women who have been accused of prostitution in Phoenix Court, which is held in Court #4. I have the necessary experience and background to be able to ensure access to justice is fair, equal, and timely. As judge, I will ensure balance and fairness for the defendants and victims that come before me.

A judge can also show equity in sentencing a defendant by considering how this sentence will affect their immigration status, time in custody, and practical consequences. During the sentencing phase, if a victim wishes to present testimony, a judge should carefully consider his/her/their testimony as well. I would work to break the cycles of abuse and recidivism.

          It is clear that our criminal justice system needs to evolve, and I am extremely pleased to see that most of the candidates for these offices are committed to criminal justice reform. I preside over one of our only diversion courts for misdemeanor offenses, known as t he Phoenix Court, which is a program for individuals arrested on prostitution charges. In lieu of a conviction, participants are given the opportunity to address the issues that make them vulnerable to committing prostitution. This is especially important since we know that prostitution can be the result of a lack of choice among the most marginalized and vulnerable people in our society. This court has transgender participants who are particularly vulnerable to being violently victimized. As an ally to the LGBTQIA+ community, my priority is to ensure that ALL participants are treated equally, are properly identified by their preferred pronouns, and more importantly that our diversion programs are inclusive. I want to continue to develop and expand this program so that more people are able to benefit from it. <br><br>
Additionally, I have already communicated to the Travis County Commissioner&rsquo;s Court my desire to add a second diversion program to Court 4 to address first time family violence offenders under the age of 21. We have an amazing opportunity at the misdemeanor level to try and offer intervention to young offenders who have no criminal history. Abusive behaviors are learned, and with the right intervention in the appropriate cases, they can be unlearned. I have seen as much in my own life where a family member who committed acts of family violence while I was a child eventually learned to modify their behavior and become a non-violent member of the family. It would have been devastating for my family if this person had been incarcerated, so I understand why it is important to get people help so we can keep families together. <br><br>
To summarize, I embrace criminal justice reform, and I look forward to collaborating with all elected officials and community leaders to continue to improve our criminal justice system.

As someone who has spent the last decade of my career fighting for equal justice, I understand it is imperative for judges to work together with the County Attorney and District Attorney to develop progressive protocols for our courts. We must find a way to end the backlog of cases in County Court at Law #4 in order to restore justice.
