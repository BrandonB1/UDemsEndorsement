          Shortly after graduating from the University of Texas School of Law, I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to begin working at a non profit domestic violence shelter. I worked at the Support Network for Battered Women as an advocate. During my work there, I was contacted by several South Asian immigrant women - many of whom had immigrated to the United States with their spouses on H1-B visas. The women who contacted me felt comfortable speaking with me about the domestic violence they were experiencing because I am an immigrant and I too had been exposed to family violence as a child. As the number of women who contacted me grew, I decided to create a support group specifically for South Asian women. It was very grassroots and we held it every week in the lobby of the agency after hours. The group grew in size because the participants had a safe space to talk about their experiences. To this day, I am most proud of the support group I created because it changed the narrative of many of the women who were victims of abuse.

          I have dedicated my career to breaking the cycle of incarceration and ensuring my clients, many of whom cannot afford an attorney on their own, receive equal access to justice. Far too often, we see instances in our criminal justice system where people are not given a fair shake in court because they are not able to afford legal services. I understand the impact when I am able to get a case dismissed or obtain an acquittal for a client. I&#39;m committed to be a voice for so many people in order for their faith to be restored in the criminal justice system. For example, one of my cases involved a young African-American male who was just 19 when I represented him. When I met with him he was in custody in the Travis County jail, and this was not his first time. At the young age of 19, his criminal history included juvenile history, misdemeanors, and a couple of felony convictions. When I brought up the possibility of getting him out of jail on personal recognizance bonds, he said not to bother, as he had never been granted a personal recognizance bond before. I was able to get him released on a bond because I discussed his case with the Judge and proposed reasonable conditions that would make the Court comfortable with his release. In addition, his family violence case in County Court at Law #4 was dismissed as he agreed to complete counseling and treatment. Unfortunately, this happens too often. This young man discounted the possibility of getting out of jail or getting a second chance because of his prior experiences. As his advocate, I was grateful for the opportunity to show that change and rehabilitation are possible for him within the criminal justice system.

          <h4>What is the most pressing issue facing the court and why are you qualified to address it?</h4><br>

          There are two equally pressing issues that should be addressed. The first relates to the fact that County Court at Law 4 handles all of Travis County&rsquo;s misdemeanor domestic violence cases. Because this is a domestic violence court, <strong>it is important that the judge be someone who understands how to protect both the victims and the community as a whole while ensuring that the defendant receives compassionate justice ,</strong> and that takes a judge with experience in this highly specialized field. Domestic violence is a complex issue, and my experience enables me to differentiate between cases where treatment and diversion can help an offender break the cycle of domestic violence and cases with a high risk of lethality where the defendant is a credible threat to the victim and the community.<br><br>

I was appointed to this bench by the Travis County Commissioners over my opponent because of my 20 years of domestic violence experience. I gained 13 years of highly valuable criminal trial experience through my work as Chief of the Family Violence Unit at the D.A.&#39;s Office (where I handled felony family violence cases ranging from strangulations to homicides while supervising and training nine Assistant DA&rsquo;s), as the Chief Prosecutor for County Court 4 at the County Attorney&rsquo;s Office, and as Chief of the Protective Order Division where we secured protective orders for victims of sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, and domestic violence. Prior to that, I spent 7 years at non-profit domestic violence agencies in Austin and the SF Bay Area working as both a legal advocate and a staff attorney. I assisted survivors of domestic violence in obtaining protective orders, custody orders, and child support. My experience also helps me understand how domestic violence can impact people beyond just the victim and the defendant. A few years ago, a defendant in a family violence case threatened not only the victim with harm but threatened to murder both me and two other prosecutors. The defendant listed each of us by name and claimed to already have our home addresses. We were especially concerned because the defendant was both highly educated and former military. As an officer of the court, I was fortunate to have police protection until the defendant was captured by the FBI, but that is obviously not the case for others in the community that may find themselves caught in the fray of a domestic violence situation.<br><br>

<strong>The second issue relates to the backlog of cases I inherited when I was appointed in October 2019 .</strong> In my short time on the bench, we have already reduced the backlog by over 20%. I am also working with the County Attorney&rsquo;s Office to create a backlog task force to move cases along and further reduce the backlog. Once the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders are lifted and we resume a normal court schedule, I will continue working hard to bring further reductions to the backlog.

          This court has the largest backlog of cases of any misdemeanor court, preventing justice from being served. Lack of a speedy trial impacts employment, housing, and safety. We need a more productive pre-trial process and to uphold current law around timelines for each side to be ready for trial. I will also work to systematically transfer all non-intimate cases to the other courts and advocate for making treatment and counseling more financially accessible.&#160; <br><br>
As a criminal defense attorney, I understand the systemic challenges we are facing in the criminal justice system. To address these challenges, we must protect a defendant&rsquo;s rights and freedoms, prevent individuals from being jailed for excessive time periods, and consider firearm forfeiture when a firearm is involved, as well as balance the need to preserve the community&rsquo;s and victims&rsquo; safety.<br><br>
Currently, if a defendant has an assault family violence case and another case (for example, a DWI or a shoplifting case), those cases are transferred away from County Court at Law #4 and into other misdemeanor courts. It is time for assault family violence cases to be heard by misdemeanor court judges who are experienced to hear these cases.<br><br>
It is critical the next Judge of County Court at Law #4 be a qualified and compassionate attorney who will correct the ongoing, systemic issues with this court. I have extensive experience practicing in Court #4 and am the only candidate who has served as a staff attorney defending women who have been accused of prostitution in Phoenix Court, which is held in Court #4. I have the necessary experience and background to be able to ensure access to justice is fair, equal, and timely. As judge, I will ensure balance and fairness for the defendants and victims that come before me.

           As the daughter of immigrants and an attorney for indigent clients, I understand the barriers that exist in the justice system and the need for systemic change. I&rsquo;ve demonstrated a commitment to justice through my work as a criminal defense attorney and by volunteering with Volunteer Legal Services of Central Texas and to help immigrants in detention centers. County court judges deal with misdemeanor offenders, who often need treatment and services rather than incarceration. A judge can also show equity in sentencing a defendant by considering how this sentence will affect their immigration status, time in custody, and practical consequences. During the sentencing phase, if a victim wishes to present testimony, a judge should carefully consider his/her/their testimony as well. I would work to break the cycles of abuse and recidivism.

          <h4>Candidates for offices like district attorney or county attorney are promising big changes to the way the criminal justice system functions in Travis County.

          It is clear that our criminal justice system needs to evolve, and I am extremely pleased to see that most of the candidates for these offices are committed to criminal justice reform. I preside over one of our only diversion courts for misdemeanor offenses, known as t he Phoenix Court, which is a program for individuals arrested on prostitution charges. In lieu of a conviction, participants are given the opportunity to address the issues that make them vulnerable to committing prostitution. This is especially important since we know that prostitution can be the result of a lack of choice among the most marginalized and vulnerable people in our society. This court has transgender participants who are particularly vulnerable to being violently victimized. As an ally to the LGBTQIA+ community, my priority is to ensure that ALL participants are treated equally, are properly identified by their preferred pronouns, and more importantly that our diversion programs are inclusive. I want to continue to develop and expand this program so that more people are able to benefit from it. <br><br>
Additionally, I have already communicated to the Travis County Commissioner&rsquo;s Court my desire to add a second diversion program to Court 4 to address first time family violence offenders under the age of 21. We have an amazing opportunity at the misdemeanor level to try and offer intervention to young offenders who have no criminal history. Abusive behaviors are learned, and with the right intervention in the appropriate cases, they can be unlearned. I have seen as much in my own life where a family member who committed acts of family violence while I was a child eventually learned to modify their behavior and become a non-violent member of the family. It would have been devastating for my family if this person had been incarcerated, so I understand why it is important to get people help so we can keep families together. <br><br>
To summarize, I embrace criminal justice reform, and I look forward to collaborating with all elected officials and community leaders to continue to improve our criminal justice system.

          Yes, judges have a unique role in ensuring criminal justice reforms are implemented into our local justice system. As someone who has spent the last decade of my career fighting for equal justice, I understand it is imperative for judges to work together with the County Attorney and District Attorney to develop progressive protocols for our courts. We must find a way to end the backlog of cases in County Court at Law #4 in order to restore justice.
